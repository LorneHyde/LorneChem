# LorneChem
This is a desktop app for basic chemistry calculations. Currently, it features an equation balancer, a formula mass
calculator, and a percentage by mass calculator.
## Recent Updates
Check this part of the page to quickly see which features have been added. Currently, no new features have been added, 
since I only just add this project to GitHub.
## Background
LorneChem started as my quarantine project during 2020. It started as a chance for me to practice writing GUIs 
and structuring my code, but it grew to be a larger application. My focus is to make it as user-friendly as possible, 
with explanations behind any user-input errors, to avoid confusing the user! I hope to develop this project even further
in the future!
## Installation
Prerequisites are:
- the **jvm** (https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- **Python** (https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
- **sympy** for Python, which you can get via ```pip install sympy``` on the command line, or by 
following the instructions **here** (https://github.com/sympy/sympy)

This app only works on Windows. The zip file containing the jar is too large to store on GitHub, so feel free to download it from my Google Drive instead (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n1JwQ0dnVZ4UrL4J0Ni3En-97wnwyw6R/view?usp=sharing). Simply download it, **unzip the folder**, and double click on the jar to run!

## Planned updates
The next feature I am planning to add will be a tool to convert mass to moles (and vice versa). This will then lead into
a tool that calculates percentage yields.
